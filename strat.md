# Suggested execution order:

### Before getting started
1. Read.  Assignment in full + man pages for printf and stdarg.
2. Understand how va_list works.  Play with this and see that you can pass args
successfully with va_list, va_arg function to read them, and va_end to end.
3. Look at edge cases for print f.  like %%.  lots of others
* see list of interesting printf edge cases
* understand there are some edge cases that will generate compiler warnings, but
still work.  dont get fooled.

### Architecting - Break out project into major components

1. Parsing the const char *format string
* Each conversion specification is introducted by the char %, and ends with
a conversion specifier.
* In between there may be:
** %[flags][width][.precision][length][specifier]
** 0 or more flags
** optional min field width
** optional precision
** optional length modifier

2. Handling interaction between flags
* See interesting table.

3. Formatting the output for each var
* Substituting in correct type from va_list
* Precision
* Field Width
* Lenght Modifier

4. Iterate this process over the entire string.

5. DONEZO!

# Background

* man 3 printf
* man 3 stdarg

### STDARG VARIABLE:
* type (va_list) is automatically declared when you include <stdarg.h>
Must declare a variable (object) of type va_list which is used by the macros va_start(), va_arg(), va_copy(), and va_end().

### STDARG FUNCTION / MACROS:
* void va_start(va_list ap, last);
** last here is the name of the var right before the variable params
* type va_arg(va_list ap, type);
** this is a type finder?
* void va_copy(va_list dest, va_list src);
* void va_end(va_list ap);

# Strat:

## parse string passed in
-parse string into array of strings that can then be processed
--thing this may have something to do with width

## struct to handle modifier type
--s: modifier table in man 3 printf

## discover the dif kinds of flags
-how many total?
-how many categories of flags?
-how do they interact?
-how do you break this down into a step by step process, if this, then that.
-what things are certain?  build those functions first.

## print out the output
-dif print functions for dif output,
ex: putnbr for numbers, putstr for string, putmem for mem

print it a piece at a time?  Or construct the whole string and then print?

## keep track of how many chars the thing printed out. . .
-have some sort of running counter.

# Printf Function Standards:
That you have the right number of parameters and arguements, otherwise it just goes over and prints garbage.

Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

Each conversion specification is introducted by the char %, and ends with
a conversion specifier.  In between there may be:
* 0 or more flags
* optional min field width
* optional precision
* optional length modifier

# Printf Assumptions that may impact things (reading from man page):
The functions vprintf(), vfprintf(), vsprintf(), vsnprintf() are equivalent to the functions printf(), fprintf(), sprintf(), snprintf(), respectively, except that they are called with a va_list instead of a variable number of arguments. These functions do not call the va_end macro. Because they invoke the va_arg macro, the value of ap is undefined after the call. S: stdarg(3).
